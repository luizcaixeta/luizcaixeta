Hello, I'm Luiz Caixeta!

I'm a Master's student in Physics at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, specializing in nonlinear dynamical systems, neuron models, and AI. Currently, I'm exploring Machine Learning applications in real-world Data Science scenarios and use my GitHub to showcase my personal projects.
